# 📦 A/B Test: UPS Ground vs. UPS SurePost

This project simulates a real-world A/B test I performed to determine whether switching from **UPS Ground** to the more affordable **UPS SurePost** could reduce costs **without compromising delivery reliability**.

🧠 Note: Due to confidentiality, the data shown here is simulated using Python to match the structure and characteristics of the original Shopify export.

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Evaluate whether **UPS SurePost** provides delivery reliability comparable to **UPS Ground**
- Estimate potential **annual cost savings**
- Simulate shipping data using Python and statistically test differences in delivery success

---

## 🧪 Methodology

- Synthetic shipping data generated with:
  - 10,000 random orders
  - Random assignment of shipping service
  - 95% delivery success rate for both services
  - Normal distribution of shipping costs (mean: $10 for Ground, $9 for SurePost)

- Statistical analysis:
  - **Chi-Square Test** to test for independence in delivery success between services
  - Comparison of average shipping costs to estimate annual savings

## 📌 Key Findings

- **No statistically significant difference** in delivery success rates  
- **UPS SurePost** is **~$1 cheaper** per shipment on average  
- Projected **annual savings of $15,000–$20,000** based on historical shipping volumes
